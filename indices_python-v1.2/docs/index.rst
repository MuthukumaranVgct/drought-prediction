Climate Indices in Python
=============================================

This project contains Python implementations of various climate index algorithms which provide 
a geographical and temporal picture of the severity of precipitation and temperature anomalies
useful for climate monitoring and research.

The following indices are provided:

-  `SPI <https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-index-spi>`__,
   Standardized Precipitation Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
-  `SPEI <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252361460_The_Standardized_Precipitation-Evapotranspiration_Index_SPEI_a_multiscalar_drought_index>`__,
   Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
-  `PET <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/dyk/potential-evapotranspiration>`__,
   Potential Evapotranspiration, utilizing either `Thornthwaite <http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/21073>`_ 
   or `Hargreaves <http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.26773>`_ equations 
-  `PDSI <http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-drought-severity-index-pdsi/>`__,
   Palmer Drought Severity Index
-  `scPDSI <http://www.droughtmanagement.info/self-calibrated-palmer-drought-severity-index-sc-pdsi/>`__,
   Self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index
-  `PHDI <http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-hydrological-drought-index-phdi/>`__,
   Palmer Hydrological Drought Index
-  `Z-Index <http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-z-index/>`__,
   Palmer moisture anomaly index (Z-index)
-  `PMDI <https://climate.ncsu.edu/climate/climdiv>`__, Palmer Modified
   Drought Index
-  `PNP <http://www.droughtmanagement.info/percent-of-normal-precipitation/>`__,
   Percentage of Normal Precipitation

This Python implementation of the above climate index algorithms is being developed 
with the following goals in mind:

-  to provide an open source software package to compute a suite of
   climate indices commonly used for climate monitoring, with well
   documented code that is faithful to the relevant literature and
   which produces scientifically verifiable results
-  to provide a central, open location for participation and collaboration 
   for researchers, developers, and users of climate indices
-  to facilitate standardization and consensus on best-of-breed
   climate index algorithms and corresponding compliant implementations in Python
-  to provide transparency into the operational code used for climate
   monitoring activities at NCEI/NOAA, and consequent reproducibility 
   of published datasets computed from this package
-  to incorporate modern software engineering principles and programming 
   best practices


Getting started
---------------

The installation and configuration described below is 
performed using a bash shell, either on Linux, Windows, or MacOS.

Windows users will need to install and configure a bash shell in order
to follow the usage shown below. We recommended either 
`babun <https://babun.github.io/>`__ or `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`__
for this purpose.

Download the code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone this repository:

``$ git clone https://github.com/monocongo/climate_indices.git``

Move into the source directory:

``$ cd climate_indices``

Within this directory, there are six subdirectories:

-  ``climate_indices``: main computational package
-  ``tests``: unit tests for the main package
-  ``scripts``: scripts and supporting utility modules used to perform processing of indices computations on climatological datasets (typically grids or US climate division datasets in NetCDF)
-  ``example_inputs``: example/reference datasets that can be used as inputs to the processing scripts
-  ``notebooks``: Jupyter Notebooks describing the internals of the computational modules
-  ``docs``: documentation files

Configure the Python environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project's code is written in Python 3. It's recommended to use 
either the `Miniconda3 <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__ (minimal Anaconda) or 
`Anaconda3 <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ distribution. The below instructions
will be Anaconda specific (although relevant to any Python `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_
), and assume the use of a bash shell.

A new Anaconda `environment <https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html>`__ can be created
using the `conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_ environment management system that comes
packaged with Anaconda. In the following examples, we'll use an environment named *indices_env* 
(any environment name can be used instead of *indices_env*) which will be created and
populated with all required dependencies through the use of the provided ``setup.py`` file.

First create the Python environment:

``$ conda create -n indices_env``

The environment created can now be 'activated':

``$ source activate indices_env``

Once the environment has been activated then subsequent Python commands will run 
in this environment where the package dependencies for this project are present.

Now the package can be added to the environment along with all required modules 
(dependencies) via `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

``$ pip install .``

Testing
-------

Initially, all tests should be run for validation:

``$ export NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1``

``$ python setup.py test``

``$ unset NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT``

If you run the above from the main branch and get an error then please
send a report and/or add an issue, as all tests should pass.

The Numba environment variable is set/unset in order to bypass Numba's
just-in-time compilation process, which significantly reduces testing times.

Indices Processing
----------------------------------

Included are scripts which interact with the core computational package to compute
one or more climate indices. These are ``process_grid.py`` which is used
to compute indices from gridded NetCDF datasets, and ``process_divisions.py`` 
which is used to compute indices from US climate division NetCDF datasets.

These Python scripts are written to be run via bash shell commands, i.e.

``$ python process_grid.py <options>``

Get involved
-------------

Please use, make suggestions, and contribute to this code. Without
diverse participation and community adoption this project will not reach
its potential.

Are you aware of other indices that would be a good addition here? Can
you identify bottlenecks and help optimize performance? Can you suggest new
ways of comparing these implementations against others (or other
criteria) in order to determine best-of-breed? Please fork the code and
have at it, and/or contact us to see if we can help.
